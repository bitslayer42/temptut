# Tutorial
This repository has a few little websites that shows some web stuff.

## one
- index.html is the main file. Notice how it links to the other two files. It has a form in it, which is how webpages can have text boxes and drop-down boxes.
- styles.css is the stylesheet. You can change fonts, colors, etc.
- index.js is the JavaScript file. 

## Assignment 1
- Create GitHub account. https://github.com/
- Install Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install git https://git-scm.com/
- Fork https://github.com/bitslayer42/temptut to your own Github account with the button in the upper right.
- Clone a copy to your local computer from Visual Studio Code.
- One way to run it locally and view the lame webpage is to install an extension in VSCode called Live Server.

- Windows:
    * Show file extensions
    * Install Windows Terminal

## Assignment 2
- There are a few more important HTML tags to know. Search the web for "html table" and "html ul". I prefer the mozilla.org results, but you could look around a few sites and whatever you like is probably fine. Also look up "div" and "span".
- In your copy of the temptut repo, create a new html file and a js file. You can use the existing files two.html and two.js as a template. Make sure you link to the js file inside the html file. 
- Add a table and an unordered list. For a first step, just type values right into the html for each item, like make a times table and a grocery list, for example.
- Now see if you can fill in the list with values using a "for of" loop. We didn't go over the index.js file, but I have added comments to each line. An example of a "for of" loop is in test.js.
- Filling the table could be done similarly using an array of arrays
